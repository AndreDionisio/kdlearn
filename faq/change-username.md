In short no. Why...? It's because when you first create your account we provision a lot of support services in the background for your account and all of these would need to get updated. This becomes problematic if you have made changes to your VM (even if you have created one file). If you really want to change your username, the only option is to delete your current account and make a new one with the desired username.
