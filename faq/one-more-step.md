As with any free service, Koding gets quite a large number of Phishing, 
Scamming, and all around bad behavior from far too many people. It is our duty 
to ensure that we aren't enabling this behavior.

Once an hour User Domains *(such as http://username.kd.io)* will present a page 
asking the viewer if this content is malicious in any way. The viewer of this 
page is free to click on the domain link, and proceed to the site normally.

If the site is pretending to be another site *(such as a Google Login)*, the 
viewer has the chance to report this site right then and there. Helping to 
ensure that Phishing sites aren't able to trick people.

As time goes on we will refine this method of Phishing prevention, in an effort 
to make it less hindering to the developer.

Thank you for understanding.
