Your VM Address can be located by visiting your [Koding IDE][ide] and 
opening up your VM Settings as seen pointed to in the image below.

![VM Settings](/faq/vm-address/vm-settings.png)

Your VM Address is the combination of your [VM Hostname][hostname] and 
your Koding Username Domain. The two must be used together. An example VM 
Address is below.
