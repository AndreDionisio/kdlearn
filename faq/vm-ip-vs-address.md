title: Should I use my VM's IP or Address?
importance: 4

Koding VM's give you access to your VM's IP, as well as an Address that 
always points to that VM's IP, so which should you use, and why?

While your VM's IP will operate perfectly fine, the IP is dynamic. In 
otherwords, it will change. Because of this, Koding gives you a [VM
Address][vm address], which will *always* point to your VM, regardless of 
IP changes, so this is what you usually want to use.

If you have trouble finding your VM Address, [click here][vm address].
