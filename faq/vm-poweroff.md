To turn off your VM, simply type in `sudo poweroff` into a Terminal. This will start a graceful shutdown process for your VM and within a few minutes you will see the UI reflect the powered down state for your VM.

Similarly, you can also do a `sudo restart` to restart your VM instead of shutting it down. A `sudo shutdown` will shutdown (not power off) a VM...there's a difference. :)
