Koding is an online development environment with the goal of simplifying 
worldwide development and providing free computation and development 
to everyone. It does this by offering Free VMs for development to anyone. The 
Koding VMs provide you with a _real_ Ubuntu OS, with a _real_ Terminal, and 
allow you to work on _real_ code. Python,PHP, C++, C, it doesn't matter. Even 
better, they are online. Accessible from anywhere in the world. Even sharable 
with teams.
