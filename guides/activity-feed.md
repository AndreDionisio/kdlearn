# Activity Feed

The [Activity Feed](https://koding.com/Activity) is your gateway to communicate with Koding community members. When you first look at it you'll see a list of Activity such as Status Updates, Code Snippets, or User Activity. A nice summary to the current heart beat of the community. Lets post a status update, letting everyone know that we just joined and what we're interested in. First, locate the Input field towards the top of the Activity Feed. It will look like the image below: 

![Input Field](/wp-content/uploads/status_update.png)

  
When you click in the field, it will expand. From here, you can change the content type and add tags. Changing the content type will offer varying ways to present your content, such as a Code Snippet or short and simple Status Updates. The Tags allow you to categorize your post, perhaps it is about [JavaScript](https://koding.com/Topics/javascript) or [GoLang](https://koding.com/Topics/golang). Below is the input field from above, expanded.

Try writing a status update, giving it a tag, and click Submit 

## Topics

Tags can be searched and followed by going to the [Topics](https://koding.com/Topics) url. Lets follow `koding-changelog` so that we can stay up to date about changes to Koding! In the upper right, locate the search field, and type `koding-changelog` into it, and then press return.

After searching, you'll be presented with the Topic you searched for. If you click on it, you'll see all of the posts under that topic, and if you click Follow you'll follow the chosen Topic.

Now that we understand how to create and subscribe to topics, lets actually learn how to program on Koding! [Next!](/development-on-koding/)
