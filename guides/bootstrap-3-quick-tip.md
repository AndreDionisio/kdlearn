# Bootstrap 3 setup for Beginners

With the recent Bootstrap release, we felt it would be handy to go over the very basics of setting up its latest incarnation, Bootstrap version 3. If you haven't heard, Bootstrap 3 offers significant changes over the previous versions. One of my favorites being Mobile First, and Always Responsive! Meaning that it is now very easy to design your layouts to support devices of multiple sizes all within a single layout. 

## Bootstrap 3 has me sold, what does it look like?

To see what it looks like, lets show a full example of setting up a Bootstrap 3 example on [Koding](https://koding.com)! Lets dive into the video below. 

And there you have it!
