# Codeigniter Installation for Beginners

In this article we will go over installing Codeigniter for beginners.

## What is Codeigniter?

Codeigniter may be old hat to some, but the tried and true frameworks tend to hold their own for quite a long time, and for good reason. It is polished, has an extensive history, and above all has a large community to back it up. 

## So how do i get started with Codeigniter?

In the following video, weâ€™ll go over the basic process of running Codeigniter on [Koding](https://koding.com). 

As you can see, setting up CI is a pretty simple process. The only 
trouble is ensuring that your LAMP stack is up and running properly, but 
thanks to [Koding](https://koding.com) this process was made easy. Koding 
comes with Apache by default, so Codeigniter _just works_. On top of 
that, we were able to get started with Codeigniter entirely in our 
browser. No downloading and installing LAMP stacks to our localhost 
required.
