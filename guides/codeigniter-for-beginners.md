# Codeigniter Installation for Beginners

In this article we will go over installing Codeigniter for beginners. Follow along, or [Try the Koding Demo](https://koding.com/Develop/Teamwork?import=http://tinyurl.com/nvq35q2) right now! 

## What is Codeigniter?

Codeigniter may be old hat to some, but the tried and true frameworks tend to hold their own for quite a long time, and for good reason. It is polished, has an extensive history, and above all has a large community to back it up. 

## So how do i get started with Codeigniter?

In the following video, we’ll go over the basic process of running Codeigniter on [Koding](https://koding.com). 

As you can see, setting up CI is a pretty simple process. The only trouble is ensuring that your LAMP stack is up and running properly, but thanks to [Koding](https://koding.com) this process was made easy. Koding comes with Apache by default, so Codeigniter _just works_. On top of that, we were able to get started with Codeigniter entirely in our browser. No downloading and installing LAMP stacks to our localhost required. 

## Can it get easier?

Why yes, it can! With Teamwork we can use the [Teamwork Import](https://koding.com/Develop/Teamwork?import=http://tinyurl.com/nvq35q2) to import the Codeigniter download immediately. What you are left with is a Codeigniter directory structure which you can immediately access in your browser to develop on. Yes, you read that right, click the link and bam, Codeigniter is up and running. We have more beginner friendly articles and videos coming in the near future, stay tuned!
