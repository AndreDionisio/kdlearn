# Get Help with Teamwork

Teamwork is a great application for Pair Programming, but an often overlooked use case is having someone show you how to do something if you're having trouble! In this article, we'll go over that! 

## Inviting others to a help session

  1. First, open up the [Teamwork](https://koding.com/Develop/Teamwork) application.
  2. Next, in the upper right click on the Tools button. This will popup a modal, with various options in it.
  3. Copy your Session ID from the upper right of the modal, underneath "Invite". It will look like `username_niju_86`
  4. With that link in hand, all you need to do is share that with someone else! When they join you, they will be in your VM along with you, and you can see each other's modifications in real time.

## Joining someone else's session

 

  1. When you are given a Session ID, copy it.
  2. Open up the [Teamwork](https://koding.com/Develop/Teamwork) application, and choose the Tools button in the upper right.
  3. On the right side of the modal that popped up, under Join, paste in the Session ID.
  4. Press return! You will be loaded into the other person's Virtual Machine, and you can both see each others actions in real time.
