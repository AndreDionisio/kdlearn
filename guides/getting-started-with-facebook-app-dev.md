# Getting started with Facebook Application Development

## You no longer need your localhost to make Facebook Apps!

Facebook application development can be giant pain, setting up your credentials, make it work with your localhost:3000 website. No more. Register an account at Koding, we will give you a linux environment where you can make your first facebook app in no time.

Below is what you see when you first visit Teamwork's Facebook Environment.

The instructions explain how to create an application on Facebook, and then tell Koding what the details of your application are.

After you have entered your Facebook Application details, click done. That's it!

Koding has stored your application details in your project, so all you have to do is learn, create, and enjoy your new application.

If you need any help, next to the Run button there is a question mark button. When used, this button will pop up helpful information related to the current example.

Now if you click the Run button, a preview window will popup showing your application running on Koding. If you click the arrow next to Run, you'll be given an additional option to Run this application directly on Facebook!

##  Easiest Facebook Application development? Yes please!

## More to Come

With Playgrounds, we hope to create an easy way for you to start all sorts of new projects. Convenient for experienced developers looking to quickly boilerplate their project, and educating for users who might be having trouble with the basics. Our Facebook Playground is just one in a long line of Playgrounds that we will be adding.

And because these playgrounds run within the Teamwork app, real time collaboration works out of the box. Just share your session id with your friends or team members, and collaborate!

Lastly, in the near future we'll be putting out documentation on how to contribute to these environments. Allowing you to give back to the community with whatever playgrounds you might want.

So stay tuned! The future for the [Teamwork](https://koding.com/Develop/Teamwork) app looks quite bright :)
