# Ghost Blog Setup and Installation for Beginners

In this article we will go over the installation process for the awesome new blogging software, [Ghost](https://ghost.org/). Follow along, or [Try the Koding Demo](https://koding.com/Develop/Teamwork?import=http://goo.gl/Q0jC59) right now!

## What is Ghost?

Ghost is an awesome new blog software written with “Just Blogging” in mind. Think WordPress without the complexity, bringing blogging back to it’s roots, so to say. This is all well and good, but with any product that is so new there is always confusion on how to install, develop, and run it.

So lets try and resolve some of that confusion. Lets go over the simple process of setting up Ghost on [Koding](https://koding.com) so you can learn it, toy with it, develop with it, and create your Ghost blog to be exactly what you want.

And there you have it! With Koding, we have configured a development Ghost server. Best of all, your Koding username domain is accessible to anyone that you share it with, so sharing our work with team members and clients is easy!

## Can I skip steps?

With Koding, of course! If you [Try the Koding Demo](https://koding.com/Develop/Teamwork?import=http://goo.gl/Q0jC59) you can import where we left off in the video, saving you the trouble of downloading and extracting Ghost yourself.

If you use the Teamwork link, make sure to still configure it for your own Koding domain, install the dependencies, and run the server as shown in the video.
