# Installing and Using KDApps

We've covered some basic Koding Applications that come preinstalled with your VM, but are there more? Of course! By visiting [Koding/Apps](https://koding.com/Apps) you will see a list of official applications. If you install one of these apps, it gives you the ability to use them in your Virtual Machine. Lets install one of these apps, shall we?

## Installing an App

From the [Koding/Apps](https://koding.com/Apps) page, select the [Aviary Editor](https://koding.com/Apps/aviary-image-editor-1)Â Application. From there, choose Install Now.

After installing the application you will be directed to your Develop page, where the icon will be added to the list of your installed applications. If you open the application by clicking on it's icon, you will be able to edit images on your VM with the editor, as seen below.

And just like that we have added a new application to our VM, enabling us to edit images in our browser, awesome!
