# What happens upon upgrade?

You just upgraded your account, what happens now?

Based on the type of resource pack you choose on the [Pricing page][pricing] you now have access to more resources, then a free account. This means that you are not confided anymore by the limitations of a free account.

## Resources

Below are the resources that get improved or added to your Koding account, explained in detail. Each one of them has been increased upon upgrade, depending on the resource pack you choose.

### CPU

Your CPUs are shared among all your running VMs. If you run only one VM, all CPUs will be utilized; if you have 10 VMs running, they will share your available CPUs.

### DISK

You can distribute this quota across all of your VMs as you need. You can allocate 40GB of disk space to one of your VMs, for instance, and to the next one you could allocate 10GB, based on the resource pack you choose.

### RAM

Memory is shared between your running VMs. Each VM starts with allocated memory. If you have 10GB limit, you can run 10VMs at 1GB, or 3 x 3GB or 1 x 10GB.

### ALWAYS ON

The maximum number of VMs that you can keep turned on 24/7. For example, you bought a package that comes with 10 VMs and one always-on VM. The VM you mark as always-on will work 24/7, however the others will be powered off automatically 15 minutes after you log out. This is a feature that is only available to upgraded accounts.

### GROUPS

If you upgraded to a Team resource pack you now have the ability to create a custom group for your Team. This means you get a private Koding for you and your team with all the resources that you choose upon upgrade.

Besides the awesome features you get upon upgrade, your VMs get moved to a premium section of Koding, that will ensure you VMs stay on 24/7 and your data is secure.

If you ever have any question regarding resources or have any issues you can make a [support request](mailto:support@koding.com).
