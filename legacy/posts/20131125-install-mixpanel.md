# Install Mixpanel

If you have a website or application, you likely need to know what your users are doing on it. Where they are going and what they are doing can give you loads of information about your product. Popular features, unwanted features, painful user experiences, analytics are the source for a massive amount of information. Traditional analytics platforms would simply track the urls of your visits, and aggregate this data into meaningful information. This works great for web _sites_, but can become an issue in the world of web _applications_. Single page web applications especially. Many of these web applications only have a handful of urls, with a vast wealth of buttons, forms, inputs and outputs that all represent potential data that needs to be tracked. This is where Mixpanel comes in. Mixpanel tracks “events”, which can be anything from a user clicking a button, to a user scrolling to the bottom of a Terms of Service page. Events are generic, and triggered by calling a JavaScript function. This flexibility means that anything that happens in your web application can be an event. 

## Mixpanel sounds great, how can i get started?

In the following video we’ll go over setting up Mixpanel. We also need an event to trigger Mixpanel, so as an added bonus we setup a basic Youtube Iframe API example to trigger the Mixpanel event when the user presses play. And there you have it! The Youtube Iframe API allowed us to fire a Mixpanel Event every time a viewer presses Play on our video. Now that you’ve seen the very basics of Mixpanel, why not try out our [Teamwork Import](https://koding.com/Develop/Teamwork?import=http://goo.gl/ffqpMI) to continue where the video left off. Just add your own Mixpanel ID into the JavaScript and you’re good to go!
