# Markdown example

# An h1 header

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. _Italic_, **bold**, `monospace`. Itemized lists look like:

  * this one
  * that one
  * the other one

Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text content starts at 4-columns in.

> Block quotes are written like so.
> 
> They can span multiple paragraphs, if you like.

Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex. "it's all in chapters 12--14"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.
    
    
    Some code
    More code
    <a href="#">hola</a>
    

## An h2 header

Here's a numbered list:

  1. first item
  2. second item
  3. third item
