# Development on Koding

Development on Koding is achieved by going to the [Develop](https://koding.com/Develop) tab. From there, you can launch Koding Applications that are used to create and edit your files, and even access your VM with a [Web Terminal](https://koding.com/Develop/Terminal). Lets go over the basic Development workflow, by creating a file and running it. Lets get started! 

## The Develop Area

When you first go to the [Develop](https://koding.com/Develop) tab you will be presented with a FileTree, and a few Koding Applications. The FileTree shows the files found in your Home directory by default, and it can be used to navigate anywhere within your Virtual Machine. 

## Opening a file with a KDApp

From the FileTree, double click the Web folder. This will expand the folder, showing you the folder's contents. Double click the file labeled `python.py`. This opens the file up with the Ace Editor. The Ace Editor is a web based text editor that has been embedded as a Koding App, so you can use it to edit your files. 

Once it's open, click on the settings menu in the upper right and choose Preview.

This will open up the Web Preview of your file. As seen below:

If you look at the top of the Preview window, there is an address. This is the public address of that file, which i being exposed by Apache. You can copy that and visit in right now in your browser. Cool right? 

Next up, lets look at managing multiple VMs, and assigning a VM to them. [Next!](/development-environments/)
