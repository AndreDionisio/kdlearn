# Editing your Profile

If you click on your avatar in the upper right, you'll go to your Koding profile page. From there, you can hover over your name or description to edit the information that people see about you. This same page also allows you to link various accounts with Koding. 

## Customizing your avatar

By default your Avatar is based off of a [Gravatar](http://gravatar.com/) for your email, if one exists. If you do not want to use Gravatar, you can choose to upload your own avatar to Koding! To do that, go to your Profile page as above. Next, click on your Avatar *within* your Profile page, a popup will then allow you to choose **Upload Image** or **Take Photo**. Upload Image will, no surprise, open a dialog to upload an image from your computer. Take Photo will use your Web Cam to take your photo right there! 

## Account Details

From your [Account](https://koding.com/Account) page you can modify your notification settings, billing info, subscriptions, and ssh keys. 

This has been a getting started series giving you a basic overview of [Koding](https://koding.com). Now that you've made it this far, why not checkout [How to Get Help with Teamwork](/get-help-with-teamwork/)
