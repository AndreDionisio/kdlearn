# How to Write for Koding University

In this article we will go over all of the expectations for articles submitted to Koding University. This includes everything from writing style to the subject of the article. If you deviate from these expectations, your article may not be accepted and you will be expected to correct the issues. Payment for articles will only occur after the content has been accepted. Note that we enforce these in an effort to give the articles a sense of consistency and quality to the reader. 

## Readability

Articles should always be clear and descriptive as possible. Koding attracts a wide variety of skill levels, so your article should embrace as wide of an audience as possible. Code examples, links and images are recommended whenever possible. As an example: [code] From your Koding Terminal, open /etc/hosts with `sudo vim` [/code] Would be better written as: [code] From your [Koding Terminal](https://koding.com/Develop/Terminal), type the following: ``` sudo vim /etc/hosts ``` [/code] As you can see, we link the Terminal App directly so that if the user is unfamiliar with it they can still open it easily. We also explicitly declare the full command for them to type in. Lastly, for readability we declare a full code block, rather than embedding it into the sentence.  

## Length

Technically there is no imposed minimum or maximum article length, as the article should simply cover the subject matter in full. The article may be rejected for not covering enough of the subject, or not covering the given subject in enough depth. Effectively this may seem like an article length requirement, but the key difference is that the the subject matter and how well it is written about defines the requirement. The moral of the story is: Don't worry about the length, focus on covering your subject in enough depth that it is useful, and do it well. 

## Syntax

Your article should be written and submitted in Markdown. Refer to this article for basic syntax help. 

## Tested on Koding VMs

All instructions should work flawlessly with a fresh Koding VM. To achieve this, you can reinitialize your Koding VM and follow your own instructions on your freshly reinitialized VM. 

## The Fine Print

Be aware that once you are paid for the article Koding will own the article in full. At the foot of the article Koding will provide your name as the author with a link of your choice _(within reason)_, as well as a link to your Koding Profile. Your article may be modified slightly to add links and general formatting improvements. The majority of this should have been done by you though, according to the above guidelines. You cannot republish the article anywhere else, but you are free to link to the article once it is published. It should go without saying, but your article must be entirely original.
